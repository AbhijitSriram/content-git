00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
<v ->In the healthcare profession,</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.760
we often see and hear things that really impact us.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.550
Now we're going to talk to healthcare professionals

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.256
to see what they think about loss and trauma and grief

5
00:00:12.256 --> 00:00:14.125
and how it impacts them,

6
00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:16.965
and how we can help improve that impact.

7
00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:20.520
(ambient music)

8
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.310
<v ->Working in a pediatric emergency department,</v>

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.813
there are a lot of sad cases that you see,

10
00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:29.226
and death and a lot of things

11
00:00:29.226 --> 00:00:32.043
that you kind of have to process.

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.875
But specifically, the one that I can think of

13
00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.162
was a few months ago, we had a six year old girl

14
00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:40.443
who came in via Life Flight.

15
00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:42.630
So she came in through a helicopter

16
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.780
in critical condition because she was hit by a car.

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.623
And,

18
00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:50.490
when she went to cardiac arrest

19
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.800
I was performing compressions.

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.019
And it was a really difficult time

21
00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.000
because I so badly wanted her to live

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.051
and just immediately get better.

23
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:04.770
But unfortunately, her injuries were too severe

24
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.120
so she did pass, and I experienced

25
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.408
probably the most profound loss I've experienced

26
00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:14.883
while working in healthcare so far.

27
00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:19.083
And that was definitely something that was difficult for me.

28
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.540
But it was nice because I had my team there to help me.

29
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.510
And afterwards, something that helps me cope

30
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.313
is to call my family.

31
00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.270
And I just journaled and did self-care

32
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.763
and that kind of helped me heal from that.

33
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.087
But it was difficult.

34
00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:41.613
<v ->The first time that I had to perform CPR,</v>

35
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.433
I lost that patient.

36
00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:48.993
And I don't know,

37
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.390
I mean, the first experience I would hope that when I do it,

38
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.923
the patient would survive.

39
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.830
But I did CPR, there was another person with me,

40
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.450
but we performed CPR and he couldn't survive.

41
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.810
And just to pronounce the time of his death,

42
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.750
I had to like see his pulse and the monitor,

43
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.528
and I was too scared to even say

44
00:02:15.528 --> 00:02:19.530
that the patient is not alive at that time.

45
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.140
So yeah, I think that in a way,

46
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.050
I got very scared to do that.

47
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.990
But after a few more CPR procedures

48
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.810
when I did revive a patient, I felt good about it.

49
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.980
But in that moment,

50
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.150
I felt like I was to blame at that second.

51
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.190
<v ->Yes, actually, unfortunately,</v>

52
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.968
one of my previous colleagues,

53
00:02:39.968 --> 00:02:43.680
she actually passed away at work.

54
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.490
So that was something that just hit us very hard

55
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.380
because she was like, I would say,

56
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.360
like the pillar in the clinic.

57
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.720
So she is the one, the glue that held everyone together.

58
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.779
And she made a huge impact on the center

59
00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.550
and in patients' lives.

60
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.800
So that was something that we had to work through.

61
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.437
But it was nice having each other, like as a little family.

62
00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:07.685
(ambient music)

63
00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:10.157
<v ->Mentorship is very important.</v>

64
00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:15.157
When we are in like a team based situation

65
00:03:17.627 --> 00:03:20.790
or a care model, it's very important for us

66
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.410
to be able to rely on others

67
00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.120
to learn what we don't know

68
00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:32.550
and be able to get support when we need

69
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.679
instead of being looked down at for not knowing something.

70
00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:40.887
So in that way, I think I've always seeked to find

71
00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:44.430
good mentors and someone who can support me

72
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.820
in that journey of something that I don't know.

73
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.920
I'm never scared to ask for help,

74
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.390
to ask them that I don't know this,

75
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.010
can you help me with this?

76
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.890
So in a way, whenever I find myself overwhelmed

77
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.060
or when I find myself having negative thoughts,

78
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.930
I make sure to voice them and seek help

79
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.420
and ask for anyone to just

80
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.663
lend their voice or even just help me navigate that.

81
00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:16.740
<v ->I just do journaling and skincare</v>

82
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.762
and I try to listen to music and wind down after work,

83
00:04:19.762 --> 00:04:24.762
and call my family just to help me decompress

84
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.690
from a high stress environment,

85
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.200
and the emotional, I guess,

86
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.770
repercussions of working in healthcare.

87
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.290
<v ->So thankfully I have a very strong support system.</v>

88
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.470
So I realized instead of me just bottling my emotions

89
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.240
that it's very important for me

90
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.630
to speak to someone about how I'm feeling.

91
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.470
Even if it's good, bad, stressed, it's good to let it out

92
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.972
instead of just bottling those emotions.

93
00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:55.320
(ambient music)

94
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.410
I would say yes, just a lot of my colleagues

95
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.810
during the pandemic overall,

96
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.030
a lot of people were getting sick.

97
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.030
We had staff shortages, we were we working nonstop.

98
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.970
People would think that, oh, there's a pandemic going on,

99
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.500
we're not going to be as busy.

100
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.342
But it was the complete opposite.

101
00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:18.510
And on top of that, we also had to learn

102
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.380
how to change our policies according to the pandemic.

103
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.476
And so I would see a lot of my colleagues

104
00:05:25.476 --> 00:05:27.720
feeling defeated in a way.

105
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.890
And that would affect me

106
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.375
especially being in the leadership role.

107
00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:32.700
<v ->All the time,</v>

108
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.229
because I work in a pediatric emergency department

109
00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.490
in a level one trauma center.

110
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.410
And there are definitely some difficult cases,

111
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.890
some critical cases, and I've seen people crying.

112
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.070
I've seen attending physicians saying they need a drink

113
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.600
and they can't wait to get home.

114
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.850
And I've seen people leave the emergency department

115
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.705
altogether just because it's emotionally exhausting

116
00:05:53.705 --> 00:05:54.960
and they're burnt out

117
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.897
from the constant trauma that they face.

118
00:05:56.897 --> 00:05:59.670
<v ->Yeah, I think, as I said,</v>

119
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.380
the ones where I had my friends with me at that time,

120
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.810
so yeah, since I was with them also.

121
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.400
But yeah, I've witnessed them

122
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.574
going through the same thing too.

123
00:06:10.574 --> 00:06:13.324
(ambient music)
